# Precision Time Protocol Optimization (PTP Optimization)

Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Optimization framework aims to optimize the time synchronization using the linuxptp suite by optimizing the Proportional-Integral servoâ€™s parameters. The proposed framework automatically searches for the best variables using a Genetic Algorithm. Different evaluation functions can be used to fulfill optimization goal.

## Hardware

PTP is implemented in PTP-aware networking hardware, that implements the IEEE 1588 standard. To succesfully run the code, an adequate Networking adapter and a proper driver must be installed in the system.

## Software

As this script uses linuxptp suite it is targeted against the linux operating system. Python3 must be installed.

### Required python packages

Use the pip to install required python packages.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
```

## Usage

To succesfully run the script with dedault settings run following code:

```bash
python3 main.py --i EnpXfY
```
where EpnXfY stnads for the interface name. If you want to check the interface name please run following command to print all interfaces name:

```bash
ip a
```
## Configureme

Configureme.py file must be used to configure the genetic algorithm and debug level.
